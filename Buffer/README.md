An instance of the Buffer class is instrumental to the working of this Python toolkit since it acts as a buffer between the difference main simulation classes in Folder *LAMMPS_classes*, which takes this Buffer instance as an argument and either stores or retrieves data from it. The Buffer class also maintains (and modifies) the MPI communicator.
