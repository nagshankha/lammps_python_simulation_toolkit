# Create different atomistic system configurations with or without defects

- Folder *construct_system_with_dislocation* has classes to construct atomstic systems with cuboid and spherical geometry
- Folder *Interfaces* has classes to construct bicrystals with planar grain boundary. It provides the user with the option to create a single grain boundary with two free surfaces or a periodic array of grain boundaries employing periodic boundary conditions in the direction perpendicular to the grain boundary plane.
- Folder *construct_system_with_dislocation* has classes to construct an atomistic system of an infinite slab with a periodic array of dislocations.
