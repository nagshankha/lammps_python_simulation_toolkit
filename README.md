# A Python wrapper simulation toolkit for running LAMMPS simulations

This is a Python wrapper toolkit for molecular statics/dynamics simulations using open-source MD simulator code LAMMPS. This toolkit runs LAMMPS from Python (https://docs.lammps.org/Python_run.html); therefore LAMMPS has to be compiled as a shared library.
